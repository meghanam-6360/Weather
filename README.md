# Weather
 A  Weather API allows applications to access real-time and forecasted weather data. It provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, air quality, and alerts for any location. Developers use it to display current weather, weekly forecasts, and climate conditions in their apps or websites.
